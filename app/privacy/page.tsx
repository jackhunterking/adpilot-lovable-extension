        <p>
          We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect your
          information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100%
          secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>

        <p>
          Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where applicable, we implement safeguards
          to protect transfers in accordance with relevant laws.
